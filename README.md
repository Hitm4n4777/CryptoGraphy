# Msg-Encryption-and-Decryption
cryptography....
python file in the repo is the main code.

- To run the code u need
  - Python (latest -ver prefered)
  - python library cryptography

the code when executed will generate a Secret key in the same directory where the python file is located.
the encrypted txt will be decrypted using that key.
Secret key is unique.
and if u lose the key u cannot decrypt the txt encrypted with that key...

if u want to share the encrypted txt with someone....
all u have to do is share ur secret key, so they can decrypt the txt.
